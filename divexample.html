            After a century of decline, overall wild tiger numbers are starting to tick upward. Based on the best
            available information, tiger populations are stable or increasing in India, Nepal, Bhutan, Russia and China.
            About 5,574 tigers remain in the wild, according to the Global Tiger Forum, but much more work is needed to
            protect this species if we are to secure its future in the wild. In some areas, including much of Southeast
            Asia, tigers are still in crisis and declining in number
