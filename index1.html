        “To create a world where sustainable living will be the norm; where equitable access to clean energy, clean air,
        and clean water will be the norm; where mutual respect and harmony for and between humankind and the environment
        will be the norm.”

        Mission
        “To meet the sustainable development goals of energy security, livelihood security, and climate security through
        the advancement of low-carbon, renewable, and energy efficient pathways. Mediating public policy to support
        national and international climate and energy goals is our prime focus.”

        “ Restoring Earth’s energy balance is the fundamental requirement for stabilizing our climate. ”

        ABOUT-WISE-CLEAN-ENERGY
        Key Initiatives
        The World Institute of Sustainable Energy (WISE) is a not-for-profit organization established in 2004, based in
        Pune, India.
        Since its inception, WISE has pioneered many important initiatives. These include:

        Developing state-level action plans/roadmaps for climate mitigation through accelerated deployment of clean
        energy technologies.
        Developing a renewable energy pathway for achieving the target of 15% renewable energy by 2020, as specified by
        the National Action Plan on Climate Change (the Government of India officially accepted WISE’s findings for
        inclusion in the five-year plan targets).
        Developing state-level vision documents and renewable energy action plans for the transition to a low-carbon and
        energy efficient economy.
        Facilitating India’s transition to a low-carbon economy by supporting implementation of national policies and
        programmes through the development of offshore wind power (for the first time ever) in India, in collaboration
        with the EU (as part of a global consortium).
        Capacity building of renewable development agencies and professionals across the country.
        Policy research and policy advocacy in critical areas like transitioning to a sustainable energy system by 2050,
        accelerating wind power and solar energy in India, power sector reforms, etc.
        Piloting a model Renewable Energy law for India.
        “ The industrial era of energy and transportation is giving way to an information technology and knowledge-based
        energy and transportation era. The combination of bit-based and electron-based technologies will put an end to
        conventional atom-based energy and transportation industries. The disruption will be a clean one.”

        wise work with International Governments
        Our work with International Governments has led to
        Strengthening cooperation with and building capacities of member countries.
        Developing implementation mechanisms for accelerating RE development and fostering sustainable development in
        India, the Asia-pacific, and West Africa.
        Our work with Central and State Governments of India has led to
        Development of policy roadmaps and regulatory frameworks for advancing RE development in the country.
        Facilitating policy and regulation in fourteen states, including Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Gujarat, Kerala,
        Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, the UT of Puducherry, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, West Bengal, Odisha, Assam and
        Manipur.
        wise work with Central and State Governments of India
        wise work with the RE Industry / Associations
        Our work with the RE Industry/Associations has resulted in
        Mediating policy to introduce appropriate financing mechanisms and boost indigenous manufacturing within the
        sector.
        Enhancing human resources/skills development to build technical and core competencies, strengthen the
        sustainable energy sector, and ensure the smooth transition to a low-carbon economy.
        “ We should spend the next decade focusing on the technologies, policies and market structures that will put us
        on the path to eliminating greenhouse gases by 2050. It is hard to think of a better response to a miserable
        2020 that spending the next ten years dedicating ourselves to this ambitious goal. ”

        Core Values
        curve line
        Integrity
        WISE Integrity
        This is the cornerstone of WISE’s beliefs and values. We are steeped in the tradition of conducting our work in
        an honest, transparent and ethical manner.
        Partnerships
        unity at wise
        For WISE, partnerships are key to forging stronger linkages that effectively meet common, sustainability goals,
        based on mutual trust and respect. Working in collaboration also provides immense value addition through the
        sharing of knowledge, resources and worldviews, thus enriching the objectives of sustainability and creating
        meaningful outcomes.
        Compassion & Respect

        Being humane is a key priority and WISE’s motto. We foster a culture of kindness, dignity and respect for all.
        We believe in valuing professional relationships and human resources, as they form the building blocks of a
        strong and healthy work environment.

        Team Work
        teamwork
        Teamwork is key to WISE’s functioning. Working as a team builds confidence, instils creative learning, and
        expands our horizons to thing big, work better, and act faster, maximizing impacts and outcomes.
        Adaptability
        Adaptability
        At WISE, we have experienced both success and failure in our endeavours. On one hand we have ridden and built on
        our success, while on the other hand, we have fallen and learned from our failures. We therefore value our
        ability to adapt the most, as it has held us in good stead, enabled us to work around problems, brainstorm
        solutions and new ideas, and most importantly, made us a more resilient organisation, prepared to take on the
        toughest of challenges, and never compromise on meeting our goals and achieving our mission.
